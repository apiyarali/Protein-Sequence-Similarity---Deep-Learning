# Protein Sequence Similarity - Deep Learning
Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques while utilizing the target encoders within the DeepPurpose library. The primary objective is to encode protein sequence data sourced from UniProt and subsequently train a model to compute pairwise similarity scores for protein amino acid sequences. The computation of protein pairwise similarity sequences is essential for the identification and characterization of drug targets. Moreover, it facilitates the refinement of drug design processes and the mitigation of off-target effects.
