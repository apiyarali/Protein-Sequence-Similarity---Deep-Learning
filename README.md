# Protein-Sequence-Similarity---Deep-Learning
Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques and target encoders from DeepPurpose, this project encodes UniProt-derived protein sequence data. Subsequent model training computes pairwise similarity scores for amino acid sequences, crucial in identifying drug targets and refining design for minimized off-target effects.
